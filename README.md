# Agent Development Kit (ADK)

The **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** is a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate the creation, management, and deployment of intelligent agents. This kit enables developers to build agents that can interact with various systems, utilize external tools, and autonomously process complex tasks.

## Features:
- **Tool Integration:** Easily link external tools (APIs, databases, scripts) to your agent for dynamic execution.
- **Customizable Agents:** Create and configure agents to suit specific needs by defining behaviors, prompts, and decision-making processes.
- **LLM Integration:** Leverage the power of large language models (LLMs) for natural language processing and decision-making.
- **Scalable Framework:** Extend and adapt the agent framework to handle a wide range of use cases, from simple queries to complex workflows.
- **Real-time Interactions:** Enable agents to respond and adapt in real-time to user inputs, environmental changes, or external data.
